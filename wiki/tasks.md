Ankit's Suggestion:
We pause the MIT course for a week and meet next week for the [Princeton Course](http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/) . Complete the Book or watch all lectures. These lectures or the book is the material that we have already covered in last three lectures in MIT course. But to get an indepth understanding of Bitcoin I would like to spend a week more.
