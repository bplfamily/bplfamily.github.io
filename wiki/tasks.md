# Weekly Tasks 


Past week tasks

1. Create a Coinlist account.
2. Complete KYC on Coinlist account


Current week tasks

1. Know more about Mina Protocol.
2. Finish 3 lectures from the MIT course

Ankit's Suggestion:
We pause the MIT course for a week and meet next week for the [Princeton Course](http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/) . Complete the Book or watch all lectures. These lectures or the book is the material that we have already covered in last three lectures in MIT course. But to get an indepth understanding of Bitcoin I would like to spend a week more.
