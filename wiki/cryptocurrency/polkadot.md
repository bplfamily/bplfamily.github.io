# Polkadot
Polkadot Parachains allocation has started, [Acala Network](https://cryptoslate.com/acala-network-wins-a-parachain-slot-on-polkadot-dot-testnet/) got the first parachain slot. To learn more about these, refer to [Parachains](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parachains) and [Polkadot Parachain Slots](https://polkadot.network/polkadot-parachain-slots/).

A **parachain** is an application-specific data structure that is globally coherent and validatable by the validators of the Polkadot Relay Chain.

### Current investment strategy

I'm planning to buy the following coins allocated $500 each:
1. [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/) (XRT)
   Robonomics Network is a protocol designed to integrate robots into the Human economy.
   
2. [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re/) (EDG)
   Edgeware is a high-performance, self-upgrading WASM smart contract platform, in the Polkadot ecosystem.
   
3. The following are the options to decide the third one.
   **EWT** (Energy) or **LINA** (Finance) or **BONDLY** (NFT exposer) or **TRAC** (Supply Chain) or **ChainX** (Interoperability) or **XOR** (DAPPs)
   
I'm currently waiting to look for a clear entry point.
